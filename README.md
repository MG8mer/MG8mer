In general, I have a decently positive outlook on life, and therefore I enjoy a variety of different things.

As an ambitious teenager I am very fascianted and interested in technology and computers, and I am aiming for a career that turns that passion into pursing fruitful objectives and logical challenges, more specifically Computer Sceince, hence why I am taking the course at my school! :computer:

Additionally, I enjoy a good intellectual hobby, which is why I started showing interest for the beautiful game of chess, and I aspire to be a formidable opponent against most players! ♟️

However, I most certainly can enjoy a good cuisine, and I recently have been expanding my food palette as a result for my intrigue towards food! And even when I can enjoy a complex dish, I cannot resist the temptation of a juicy Burger! :hamburger:

`And that is who I am in a nutshell!` 

Of course, any person could go on for hours on their complex personality and train of thought, but this is not English class, and if I were to write a whole essay on who I am, it would bore the hell out of my teacher, and most importantly you the reader!

But before I go, I must show you some cool **(but potentially peculiar so tread carefully)** things!:

Here is fanart of a Minecraft youtuber named Technoblade *(who passed away in 2022 may he rest in peace)* drawn by my best friend's sister

<img width="395" alt="TechnoPiggy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123292179/213920944-6d4362b9-9bec-442e-94f5-11aa47243841.png">

I typically have it as my profile picture in most places, the art is just absolutely incredible and its a way to honor the noble Technoblade, even if its long after his death.

[Here is another cool thing you can check out](16personalities)

The website is a very detailed personality test that takes around 10 minutes to complete, and after completion the website gives you a personality that *(according to most people)* provides a **scarily** accurate overview of their personality.

I have the `ENFJ-T` personality type, which is referred to as *Protaginist* on the website, take the test and check out your and other peronalities!
